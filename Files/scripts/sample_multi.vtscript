Script.Start[general]
	Lets try multiple personalities!

	// for now there is no way to get a random contact, so lets add Piper or Lisa.
	//#if(not .id == "piper")
		#AddContact(Personality.Piper)
	//#else
		#AddContact(Personality.Lisa)
	#GoTo(Script.Simple)

// note: this script requires there to be at least two contacts.
Script.Simple
	#RequireContacts(2)
	
	// Note how AddContact accepts a personality, where the rest will only accept a number.
	// That is so this script is generic, it can be ran for any contacts, as long as there is at least two.
	
	// Main contact is running, but we can get the other contact's variables.
	And now @(Contact.1.Self.Name) will be joining us.

	// set the new contact as active. Only one contact can be active at once, so the main(0) contact will be disabled and swap with 1.
	#ActivateContact(1)
	
	// we are going to remove the active contact(0), lets hold the personality as a variable, so we can use it latter.
	#(local.c = Contact.0)

	// now all scripts will be ran from the new contact.
	#GoTo(Script.sample.Introduction)
	
	Bye

	// when a active contact gets removed, the next contact gets set as active.
	#RemoveContact(0)
	Well now that @(local.c.name) is gone, lets do something else.
